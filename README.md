# currency-converter
## Developed by Kevin Pham

## Summary
using Java to create a currency converter for 2-3 different countries' currencies (usd, yen, dong)

## Reason for Program
to practice using Java again and making something simple that includes conversions in a more interactive way rather than just typing "usd to dong". This program also handles some other methods of the currencies. This include the other "possible" keywords. For example: "United State Dollars - USD" can be taken in as United, State, Dollars, USD.
